## 📋 Next Steps to Complete the Project

### Step 1: Start Your React App (5 minutes)

```bash
cd /Users/macbookair/Downloads/Hackathon/quantum-sync
npm start
```

✅ **Verify:** App opens at http://localhost:3000

---

### Step 2: Set Up n8n Workflow (30-45 minutes)

Open your n8n instance:
```
https://falco.app.n8n.cloud
```

Follow the **SINGLE_WORKFLOW_SETUP.md** guide to create:

**Main Workflow Structure:**
```
1. Webhook Trigger (automation)
2. Switch Node (route by type)
3. HR Branch (8 nodes)
4. Finance Branch (9 nodes)
5. Merge Node
6. Response Node
```

#### Quick Setup Order:

1. **Create New Workflow**
   - Name: "QuantumSync Automation"

2. **Add Webhook Node**
   - Path: `automation`
   - Method: POST
   - ✅ Test: Should show webhook URL

3. **Add Switch Node**
   - Output 1: `{{ $json.type === "hr" }}`
   - Output 2: `{{ $json.type === "finance" }}`

4. **Build HR Branch** (from Switch Output 1)
   - Extract Data → Calculate Score → Route by Score → Emails → Slack → Google Sheets

5. **Build Finance Branch** (from Switch Output 2)
   - Extract Data → Duplicate Check → Fraud Analysis → Route by Amount → Emails → Slack → Google Sheets

6. **Add Merge Node**
   - Connect both branches

7. **Add Response Node**
   - Send success response back to React app

8. **Activate Workflow**
   - Toggle switch to ON

1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/test
2. Click "Test Connection" for HR
3. Click "Test Connection" for Finance
4. ✅ **Verify:** Both show success

#### Test 2: HR Workflow
