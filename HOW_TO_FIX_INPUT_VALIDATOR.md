# ✅ FIXED INPUT VALIDATOR CODE

## 🐛 What Was Wrong

Your code had these issues:

1. **Line 25-26:** Tries to access `binary.file.fileName` even when binary doesn't exist
   ```javascript
   const fileName = binary.file.fileName || '';  // ❌ Crashes if no binary!
   ```

2. **Line 30:** Tries to access `binary.file.fileSize` even when binary doesn't exist
   ```javascript
   const fileSize = binary.file.fileSize || 0;  // ❌ Crashes if no binary!
   ```

3. **Line 36-40:** Checks for fields on `body` instead of `body.data`
   ```javascript
   if (body.type === 'hr' && !body.email) {  // ❌ Should be body.data.email!
   ```

---

## ✅ The Fixed Code

I've created the fixed code in: **`n8n-input-validator-FIXED.js`**

### Key Changes:

1. **Only validate file if it exists:**
   ```javascript
   // Only check file if binary data is provided
   if (binary && binary.file) {
     // ... file validation here
   }
   ```

2. **Access fields from body.data:**
   ```javascript
   if (body.type === 'hr') {
     const hrData = body.data;  // ✅ Get data object first
     if (!hrData.email) {       // ✅ Then check fields
       throw new Error('Email required');
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Better logging:**
   ```javascript
   console.log('Received type:', body.type);
   console.log('Received data:', body.data);
   console.log('Has binary:', !!binary);
   ```

## 🚀 How to Update Your n8n Node

### Step 1: Copy the Fixed Code

Open the file I just created:
```
/Users/macbookair/Downloads/Hackathon/quantum-sync/n8n-input-validator-FIXED.js
```

**Select all and copy** (Cmd+A, Cmd+C)

---

### Step 2: Paste in n8n

1. **Go to your n8n workflow**
2. **Click the "Input Validator" node**
3. **Select all existing code** (Cmd+A)
4. **Paste the new code** (Cmd+V)
5. **Click "Execute node"** to test
6. **Save** (Cmd+S)

---

### Step 3: Activate & Test

1. **Make sure workflow is Active** (toggle ON)
2. **Go back to your React app**
3. **Refresh the page** (to clear any cache)
4. **Click "Test Connection"** for HR
5. **Should work!** ✅

## 📊 What The Fixed Code Does

### For JSON-only requests (from React):
```
Webhook receives:
{
  type: "hr",
  data: {
    name: "Test",
    email: "test@example.com",
    skills: [...],
    experience: 5,
    resumeUrl: "..."
  }
}

✅ Validates type field
✅ Validates data object exists
✅ Validates HR-specific fields (email, name)
✅ Skips file validation (no file provided)
✅ Returns clean data for next nodes
```

### For requests with PDF uploads:
```
Webhook receives:
- JSON body (same as above)
- Binary file (PDF)

✅ Validates type and data
✅ Validates PDF file exists
✅ Validates file type (.pdf)
✅ Validates file size (<10MB)
✅ Returns both data and file
```

---

## 🎯 Quick Summary

**Old code:** Crashed because it tried to access `binary.file` even when no file was sent

**New code:** 
- Checks if file exists first
- Only validates file if present
- Correctly accesses fields from `body.data`
- Works with JSON-only AND file uploads

---

## 🧪 Test It Now

1. **Update the code in n8n** (copy from n8n-input-validator-FIXED.js)
2. **Save and activate**
3. **Refresh React app**
4. **Click test buttons**
5. **Watch it work!** 🎉

## 📝 Expected Results

### In Browser Console:
```
🚀 Submitting candidate to n8n webhook: {type: "hr", data: {...}}
📍 URL: https://falco.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/automation
✅ n8n response: {...}
```

### In n8n Executions:
- ✅ Green checkmark
- ✅ All nodes execute successfully
- ✅ Data flows through workflow
