# üîç DEBUG: Find Where Type Field Lives

## The Problem
The validator can't find the `type` field even though we're sending it from the frontend.

## What to Do NOW

### Step 1: Update the Input Validator Code
I've added extensive debugging to show you EXACTLY where n8n is putting the data.

**Copy this updated code into your n8n Input Validator node:**
- File: `n8n-input-validator-FIXED.js`
- It now logs ALL keys and checks multiple locations

### Step 2: Test from Frontend

1. Start your frontend:
```bash
cd /Users/macbookair/Downloads/Hackathon/quantum-sync
npm start
```

2. Go to http://localhost:3000/finance (easier - no file needed)

3. Fill in the form:
   - Vendor: Test Corp
   - Amount: 1000
   - Invoice Number: INV-001
   - Date: 2025-10-19
   - Line Items: Item 1, Item 2

4. **Submit**

### Step 3: Check n8n Execution Logs

1. Go to n8n ‚Üí Executions
2. Click the failed execution
3. Look for the console logs that say:

```
=== DEBUG: Raw Input ===
Full JSON: { ... }

=== ALL KEYS ===
Keys in inputJson: [...]  ‚Üê THIS IS THE KEY INFO!
```

### Step 4: Send Me the Output

**Copy and paste these specific lines:**

1. What are the keys? 
   - `Keys in inputJson: [...]`

2. What does the Full JSON look like?
   - The entire JSON structure

## Why This Happens

n8n's webhook node might be structuring form-data in different ways:

### Possibility 1: Direct fields
```javascript
{
  type: "finance",
  vendor: "Test Corp",
  amount: "1000"
}
```

### Possibility 2: Nested in body
```javascript
{
  body: {
    type: "finance",
    vendor: "Test Corp"
  }
}
```

### Possibility 3: String body
```javascript
{
  body: "type=finance&vendor=Test+Corp&amount=1000"
}
```

### Possibility 4: Parameters object
```javascript
{
  parameters: {
    type: "finance",
    vendor: "Test Corp"
  }
}
```

**The debug logs will show us which one it is!**

## Quick Fix Once We Know

Once you send me the output, I'll know exactly how to access the data and fix it in 30 seconds.
